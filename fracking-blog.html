						Hydraulic Fracturing and Horizontal Drilling
					</h1>
					<p class="article-subheader">
						This controversial method of fossil fuel extraction has been under
						scrutiny by envrionmental groups due to cases of water contamination
						and earthquakes but fracking and horizontal drilling have proved to
						be a key part in the United States efforts in lowering its CO2
						emissions.

					<p class="article-text">
						The controversial method of hydraulic fracturing is a revolutionary
						new way to take fossil fuel sources such as oil and natural gas from
						the ground. The process consists of a drill rig digging a well deep
						into the ground where these fuels are located. With the combination
						of water, chemicals, and pressure, the fossil fuels begin to rise
						the surface of the well. This process allows for previously
						impossible sources of fossil fuels, such as tightly formed shale
						rock, to now be extracted for natural gas. This has produced a large
						supply of global energy causing a significant price drop. The facts
						are that this new type of drilling stimulates the economy by
						allowing for cheaper fuel sources and creating temporary jobs.
						However, fracking has faced large opposition primarily from
						environmental advocacy groups, and from local communities and
						politicians that are directly affected by fracking. Fracking has its
						benefits, as well as its drawbacks, and it’s important to understand
						both before someone can make an informed decision on this
						complicated issue.

					<p class="article-text">
						In an economic sense, the pros of fracking are evident as the
						fracking industry provides an opportunity for temporary jobs and
						macro-economic stimulation through vast energy savings. Fracking
						operations often takes place in communities that are in an economic
						downturn. These fracking rigs often employee locals within the
						community giving the local economy a much-needed jumpstart. The
						process of fracking has also created a tremendous surplus of fossil
						fuels. At one point society thought we would soon run out of fossil
						fuels, as consumers saw energy prices skyrocketing. With the
						introduction of fracking, the industry has created a large surplus
						of various energies with supply far exceeding demand. This reduction
						in price has caused global energy consumers to save billions of
						dollars. Yale economists state that American’s alone have saved $103
						billion on natural gas because of fracking. In 2008, when fracking
						became more prevalent, the prices of natural gas fell $4.02 while
						America was using nearly 35.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
						The billions saved often stimulate the overall economy because of
						increased consumer spending and consumption.
					</p>

					<p class="article-text">
						Economic reasons aside, you can make a case for fracking from an
						environmental standpoint as well. Natural gas is cleaner than coal
						in terms of emissions so a long-term increase in natural gas could
						make dirty coal emissions less and less prevalent. However, many
						studies and researchers have claimed that this is misleading. A
						Stanford review of 200 earlier studies found that emissions of
						methane from fracking was much higher than officially reported.

					<p class="article-text">
						While fracking has a definite economic benefit and someone could
						make an argument for a net reduction in greenhouse gases, it comes
						with controversy. A few issues that come up relate to drinking water
						quality, earthquakes, infrastructure and resources. In terms of air
						quality, what we know right now fracking and natural gas is an
						improvement from coal fired energy productions. Drinking water is a
						different story. Many people have reported that after fracking took
						place near their residence, tap water that they depended on for
						drinking and bathing was contaminated. In some cases, it was
						poisoned with Arsenic levels five times higher than a safe amount.
						Fracking has caused a lot stress and displacement for certain
						communities especially in terms of drinking water but corporations
						who employee fracking methods often claim that the water was
						contaminated before their arrival. After thorough research, it can
						be concluded that fracking has affected people’s drinking water in
						ways that are unacceptable. However, these cases are extremely few
						and far between in terms of the scale in which fracking is taking
						place. When making decisions about this form of drilling, drinking
						water horror stories need to be assessed with perspective of the
						full situation.

					<p class="article-text">
						In many places like Texas and Oklahoma, fracking is causing seismic
						concerns. There has been a large increase in earthquakes within this
						region in the past 15 years. This large increase is troubling
						because many geologists claim that oil and gas extraction in the
						area has triggered a fault line that has typically been inactive. A
						study from the 2014 Annual Reviews of Environment and Resources
						states that “between 1967 and 2000, geologists observed a steady
						background rate of 21 earthquakes of 3.0 Mw or greater in the
						central United States per year. Starting in 2001, when shale gas and
						other unconventional energy sources began to grow, the rate rose
						steadily to [approximately] 100 such earthquakes annually, with 188
						in 2011 alone.” However, these changes haven’t been studied in depth
						and makes things difficult when assessing the impact. Pro-fracking
						advocates claim that fracking has had little to no impact on these
						earthquakes and that they are simply natural occurrences. To date
						these earthquakes have caused no injuries or damages.

					<p class="article-text">
						A Harvard study and report claims that as of March 2014 there have
						been nearly 15 million Americans with a fracking rig one mile or
						less from their homes. With this information, it seems that fracking
						is literally taking place in people’s backyards. Another problem is
						that the fracking process is extremely water intensive. A fracking
						well can use anywhere from 2 – 20 million gallons of water to
						complete the fracking process. This water is typically taken from
						local water sources creating a lasting impact. It is also simply not
						enjoyable to live near a fracking rig. Living near a fracking rig
						ultimately decreases quality of life by hurting the surrounding
						landscape while also driving down property value. If an oil company
						decides to create a rig next to your house, it will be increasingly
						difficult to sell that house.
					</p>

					<p class="article-text">
						Many different scientists, journalists, energy workers,
						environmentalists, and politicians have weighed in on this issue.
						There are a multitude of different studies, experiments, and
						research that cover the entire spectrum for and against fracking. I
						believe that state and federal governments will never completely ban
						fracking and for good reason. The monetary benefits are simply too
						large for the fossil fuel dependent society we live in today.
						However, fracking needs to be done responsibly and with tact.
						Fracking should be occurring in places with large natural gas shale
						reserves located in remote areas. These remote places should be
						studied and examined closely to make sure they are not harming the
						wildlife or overall ecosystem in a significant way. While there is
						obvious externality production in any energy industry, there is no
						excuse for negligence in search of extra profit, especially in the
						case of safe drinking water. I believe that the natural gas industry
						is a crutch to lean on, as we continue to search for cleaner
						renewable energy. This crutch should not paralyze us or force us to
						go backwards in our innovation efforts towards clean energy. We
						should continue to invest, subsidize and incentivize in clean energy
						but this doesn’t mean that we can’t have a balanced portfolio of
						energy types as we make this transition. While natural gas and
						fracking isn’t perfect, we should continue to use this cheap,
						efficient, and relatively cleaner fossil fuel. During this time, we
						need to make sure we are constantly studying the effects of natural
						gas on plate tectonics, the atmosphere, and water. I believe one day
						the entire planet will be run on renewable clean energy but that day
						is much farther along and we are going to need natural gas to get us
						there.
