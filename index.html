					<p class="article-subheader">
						Hyrdo-electrcity powers a significant portion of the world and many
						companies, organizations, and governments are looking to expand
						hydro-electric capabilities. With bodies of water already in use
						within the developed world, energy pioneers now turn to the
						developing world to generate power for those who are currently
						without electrcity.

					<p class="article-text">
						The developing world has an energy problem. Based on the 2016 World
						Energy Outlook report nearly 1.2 billion people are still without
						electrcity - nearly 16% of the population. This is predominatley
						occuring in sub-Saharan Africa, and developing countries within Asia
						and South America. No or limited access to electricty is a
						significant problem for necessities such as lighting, heating,
						cooking and hygiene. Without electricity, many individuals and
						families resort to the burning of biomasses for heat and cooking.
						This creates unhealthy, and often unsanitary, living conditions
						depending on the biomass being used. With these problems in mind, we
						must look for innovative energy solutions to bring electricity into
						these impoverished communities.

						One solution that both public and private organizations are looking
						at is hydro powered energy. Hydro power provides energy in a clean
						and sustainable way and does so with very low operating costs;
						making it attractive for developing nations. It is more reliable and
						stable than its renewable counterparts and it is also cleaner and
						safer compared to fossil fuels. However, there are some downsides.
						The initial cost to build a hydro plant or dam is incredibly
						expensive. This makes it challenging for some developing countries
						to build without assistance from foreign governments or private
						organizations. There are also various environmental concerns. Issues
						include: flooding, drought, and damage to marine life within the
						area. Also, while the capacity factor for larger dams are high, the
						capacity factor for smaller/cheaper dams is very limited. This needs
						to be considered since most dams in developing nations will be
						relatively small. Weighing the net energy and externalities
						produced, while also factoring in environmental and social pros and
						cons, I believe that hydro power is a very viable energy source in
						the developing world and it is one that needs to continue to be
						improved upon.

					<p class="article-text">
						Currently, hydropower is the world's largest renewable energy source
						powering more than 16% of the world’s energy. This is mainly from
						developing nations with relatively small dams and plants. Many
						countries simply can’t afford costly fossil fuel operations for
						electricity, and since most countries can&#8217;t even afford a
						fossil fuel based energy infrastructure, other renewables such as
						wind and solar are completely out of the question. With a lack of
						infrastructure, energy costs are extremely high in these rural,
						urban, and remote locations. Initial investments in hydro
						infrastructure are extremely costly but the economic benefits to
						follow are typically ROI positive. In addition, hydro power makes
						sense to use when other forms aren&#8217;t readily available because
						many countries have access to bodies of water. Rural villages who
						harness these local bodies of water will be able to leverage these
						natural assts and provide themselves with affordable electricity.

						The World Bank, an international financial agency, has created many
						development projects in countries where energy was typically not
						sustainable or economically feasible. In a northeastern region of
						Tanzania, they have invested nearly $469 million dollars into
						creating, expanding, and connecting hydro power and transmission
						lines within the region. Thermal electric generation previously cost
						$0.25/kWh; a ludicrously high price to pay in such an economically
						poor region. For a price reference, that price per Kilowatt hour is
						double the price of electricity in Colorado. However, after the
						project is finished the price is expected to drop dramatically to
						$0.062/kWh, a much more reasonable cost.

						Hydro power has immense benefits to the developing world with its
						low operating costs, environmental benefits, and renewability.
						However, there are a few cases where hydro can lead to large costs
						and damage to the natural world. One risk to the environment caused
						by hydro is how it affects certain fish populations when they go
						through the dams or processing plants. Research published by the
						Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy stated, “When fish enter
						the dam, water is decompressed to a point where the fish can no
						longer control where they swim. This causes them to be thrown into
						walls of the dam, which causes stress, tears, and even death.” The
						reason this is so concerning is because fish are a vital part of
						marine ecosystems. Not only do other animals depend on these fish to
						survive but the human populations often rely on these fish for their
						livelihoods and food sources.

					<p class="article-text">
						Flooding due to breakage or leaks, as well as severe droughts are
						unlikely but serious concerns. It is important to account for these
						scenarios because these issues cripple small rural communities. In
						the case of a flood, the concern is that the flooding would displace
						many people from their homes along with destroying crops and
						agriculture. The possibility of drought, which is much more likely
						to occur, is also a very serious concern. Restricting water flow
						during a drought can cause agricultural concerns to local farmers.
						It is also worth noting that the price of energy produced is
						directly correlated to water flow. This means with less water flow,
						the turbines within the hydro plant would spin slower, produce less
						energy, and drive up the cost of electricity. This is why some
						advocate for fossil fuels. In contrast, using fossil fuels creates a
						significantly less degree of variability in terms of energy
						production. Variability of supply and price is something that these
						rural communities cannot afford.
					</p>

					<p class="article-text">
						When discussing hydropower, many people challenge the idea of how
						sustainable it is. The world’s population is always growing but we
						have a finite source of river and streams we can use to create hydro
						power. However, an Environmental Impact Assessment stated, "while we
						currently produce close to 3,300 TWh/y of hydropower, the world has
						a technical potential for 16,400 TWh/y many of which comes from
						developing nations." Since hydro power still has an opportunity to
						impact global energy, I believe that developing nations should
						continue to invest in hydro power. Developing nations should have a
						diverse portfolio of energy options; including both fossil fuels and
						renewables. Investing in whatever makes the most economic sense,
						what will produce the most energy for the most people, and
						sustainable renewable energy will be optimal for both people and
						planet.
